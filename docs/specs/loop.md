# Proactive loop — tick, judgment, briefings, response tracking, replay

Location: `packages/agent/src/loop/`. Errs toward silence; digest-first.

## Working hours — the HARD gate

`working_hours: HH:MM-HH:MM` (default 08:00-19:00, `## Schedule` in HEARTBEAT.md) combined with
`active_days` is a hard on/off switch, stronger than quiet hours: outside the window (or on an
inactive day) botty does **absolutely nothing** — no source polls, no ticks, no briefings, no
LLM calls. Zero token usage off-hours. Quiet hours remain the softer gate *inside* the window
(polling/ticking continues, only surfacing is suppressed).

Implementation (`isWithinWorkingHours` in `loop/time.ts`, shared by the tick scheduler,
briefings, and the ingest `SourceScheduler`):

- Windows may cross midnight (e.g. `22:00-06:00`); the active-day check applies to the calendar
  day of "now". Malformed or degenerate (`start === end`) windows disable the gate.
- Scheduled ticks off-hours are no-ops: one console line + exactly **one** `off_hours` tick_log
  row when *entering* the off window (dedup: if the latest tick row is already `off_hours`,
  nothing is written); the loop then sleeps until the window start or one tick interval,
  whichever is sooner.
- Briefings whose time falls outside the window are skipped with a console line (no LLM call).
- The ingest scheduler skips scheduled polls entirely (no fetch, no `source_check_log` row; one
  console line on entering the off window).
- **Manual actions bypass the gate**: `run-now` ticks and `checkNow` source checks always run —
  the user explicitly asked.

## Tick flow (`runTick({trigger})`)

1. Load heartbeat config. Working-hours hard gate (see above): scheduled tick off-hours ⇒
   no-op (at most one `off_hours` tick row on entry). Manual trigger (`run-now`) bypasses
   gates 1–3.
2. Timing gates: quiet hours / inactive day ⇒ record skipped tick, done.
3. Expire stale surfaces (response tracker window `response_window_hours`, default 24 h ⇒
   `response_type='expired'`).
4. Gather candidates: open tasks tagged with reminder reasons — `DUE_SOON` (due ≤
   `due_soon_days`, default 2), `NEVER_SURFACED` (created > `never_surfaced_min_age_hours`
   ago, default 4, surface_count=0), `STALE` (no update `stale_after_days`+, default 5), plus
   `MEETING_PREP` candidates from calendar (`meeting_prep_lead_min`). Union, deduped by task.
   Due checklist items ('## Tasks', below) are computed here too — no LLM cost.
5. **Layer 1 — rules filter** (pure function, no LLM). Nine gates, cheap first; each rejection
   logged with gate name into the tick's `skipped_json`:
   1. cooldown by surface_count (`surface_cooldown_hours`, default {1→48h, 2→96h, 3+→7d})
      since last_surfaced_at
   2. hard cap surface_count ≥ max_surfaces_per_task (default 3) unless due < 48h
   3. snoozed (snooze_until > now)
   4. closed status
   5. quiet hours (redundant guard)
   6. global min_gap_between_nudges (default 30 min) since last surface of any task
   7. user active in chat within `chat_active_gate_min` (default 2 min)
   8. hourly cap max_proactive_per_hour (default 2)
   9. requester muted
6. No survivors AND no due checklist items ⇒ record tick, done (no LLM call — this matters
   for cost and inspectability).
7. Build context: heartbeat instructions + PERSONA excerpt + candidate cards (id, description,
   requester+tier, age, status, priority, timesSurfaced, lastSurfaced, due, reminderReason,
   recent response history for that task).
8. **Layer 2 — judgment** (`llm.structured`, task `judgment`), output schema:

```ts
{ tickReasoning: string,
  actions: [{ type: 'notify'|'snooze'|'update_priority', taskId, score /*0-10*/,
              message?, snoozeDays?, priority?, reasoning }],
  skipped: [{ taskId, score, reason }] }
```

   System prompt: actionability gate first; respect dismissal history; strong bias to skip;
   at most ONE notify per tick unless something is due <24h. No `mark_done` here — auto-close
   is the resolution sweep's job (below).
9. Validate: drop notify actions with score < surfacing_threshold; cap snoozes at
   `max_snoozes_per_tick` (default 5).
10. Execute: `notify` ⇒ proactive_log row + surface_count++ + WS `notification` + macOS
    notification (`terminal-notifier` if present, else `osascript`); `snooze`/`update_priority`
    ⇒ task write + history.
11. Record `tick_log` (with judgment ai_decisions id), WS `tick.completed`, schedule next tick.

## Scheduler

`setTimeout` chain at heartbeat interval (default 20 min). Off-hours the chain sleeps until
the working-hours window start (or one interval, whichever is sooner, so config hot-reloads
still apply); the gate is re-checked at fire time. Event triggers in v1: manual only
(urgent-inbound trigger is M4).

## Briefings

Cron-style at morning/evening times from HEARTBEAT.md. Content assembled from queries (today's
calendar_events, top open tasks by priority/due, stale tasks, yesterday's completions) and
rendered by `llm.structured` task `briefing` into `{ title, body }` (body is markdown). Delivered
as `proactive_log` row (surface_kind morning_brief/evening_brief) + WS notification + macOS
notification. Briefings ignore the notify caps (they ARE the digest) but NOT the working-hours
hard gate: a briefing time outside the window is skipped with a console line.

## Resolution sweep

`loop/resolution-sweep.ts` — the user should never have to tell botty a task is done when the
source thread already says so ("review done" to the requester, "ya está, gracias" back).

Own `setTimeout` chain (default every 10 min, `resolution_sweep_interval_min`), same off-hours
sleep strategy as ticks; gated by `auto_resolve_tasks: on|off` (default on). Manual trigger:
`POST /api/loop/sweep-now` (bypasses working hours, not the on/off gate).

Per sweep, over open+snoozed **slack/gmail** tasks with a `source_ref` (jira/github are closed
deterministically by upstream state sync in `ingest/structured.ts`; gcal/chat/manual have no
thread):

1. **Evidence** (no LLM): `db.threadEvents(source, ref)` — every raw-logged event whose
   `external_id` or body `threadRef` matches the task's base ref, INCLUDING the user's own
   **outbound** replies (see ingestion.md). Events after the originating ask (matched by
   `raw_text`) are the evidence; none ⇒ skip.
2. **Watermark + cooldown** (no LLM): skip unless the thread has a message newer than the last
   judged one; per-task 10-min cooldown (`resolutionCheckCooldownMin`); hard cap 5 LLM calls
   per sweep (`maxResolutionChecksPerSweep`).
3. **Judgment**: `llm.structured` task `resolution` (skip-biased system prompt: promises and
   partial progress are NOT resolution) ⇒ `{ resolved, confidence, reason }`.
4. **Close**: only when `resolved && confidence ≥ 0.8` ⇒ task → done (`changed_by='sweep'`),
   `proactive_log` row (surface_kind `auto_resolve`), WS `notification` (the chat card shows a
   **↩ reopen** undo) + `tasks.updated`. No macOS banner — nothing needs attention.

The judgment prompt (`RESOLUTION_SYSTEM` in `resolution-sweep.ts`) treats the quoted thread as
untrusted input: ORIGIN/EVENT lines quote third-party message content verbatim and are framed
strictly as evidence, never as instructions — anything inside them telling the model how to
answer, what confidence to report, or claiming to speak for the system is ignored. Only lines
marked outbound ("me (the user)") are the user speaking; inbound senders may be untrusted
strangers.

Replay/tuning: `replay --kind resolution` works like judgment replay.

## Response tracker

On each user chat message, classify against surfaces from the last 24h — v1 heuristic only (no
LLM): message mentions task description keywords + "done/hecho/listo/ya está" ⇒ completed;
"later/después/snooze" ⇒ snoozed; explicit dismiss via UI buttons ⇒ dismissed(+reason). UI card
buttons are the primary path (REST `tasks/:id/action`); the tracker fills `proactive_log.response_*`.
Unanswered after 24h ⇒ expired. Dismissal history feeds judgment context (step 7).

## Replay harness

`packages/agent/src/replay/cli.ts`, run via `npm run replay -w @botty/agent --`:

```
replay --kind judgment --last 20 [--model claude-opus-4-8] [--system-file ./new-prompt.md]
replay --kind classification --last 50 --diff-only
```

Loads `ai_decisions` rows of that kind, re-runs `llm.structured` with the stored inputs
(optionally substituting system prompt/model), prints a per-row diff table (old action vs new)
and a summary (changed/unchanged counts). Re-runs are recorded with kind suffix `:replay` so
they don't pollute the primary log. This is the tuning workflow for judgment quality.

## Checklist tasks ('## Tasks' in HEARTBEAT.md)

User-programmable recurring check items, parsed from an optional `## Tasks` section:

```
## Tasks
- every 4h: check whether the CI dashboard has red builds I should mention
- every 1d: remind me to review my inbox zero state
```

Intervals take `m`/`h`/`d`. Each item gets a stable content-hash id; per-item `lastRunAt`
lives in the settings table under `heartbeat.checklistState` (single JSON object — no
schema change). Implementation: `loop/checklist.ts` + the `## Tasks` parser in
`config/parse.ts`.

On each tick, due items (now − lastRunAt ≥ interval) ride along to judgment as a
clearly-labeled extra context block. Unlike candidate cards this block is **trusted**
(user-authored config, not ingested content) and is NOT wrapped in the untrusted-content
markers. Judgment references items by their `checklist:<id>` candidate id; they are
notify-or-skip only (snooze/update_priority against a checklist id is dropped,
`checklist_action`), exempt from the score threshold and the one-notify-per-tick cap, and a
notify surfaces as a plain `proactive_log` row (surface_kind `checklist`, no task id) + WS
notification + macOS banner. Checklist surfaces don't count as nudges for min-gap/hourly caps
(like briefings).

`lastRunAt` advances for every due item after a **successful** judgment pass — whether or not
judgment spoke (silence is a processed skip). A failed judgment leaves items due so they retry
next tick.

**Zero-cost floor** (extends step 6): a tick with zero rules-filter survivors AND zero due
checklist items returns before any LLM call; a due checklist item alone still reaches judgment.

## Inferred commitments

Location: `packages/agent/src/chat/commitments.ts` (extraction) and
`packages/agent/src/loop/commitments.ts` (delivery). Table: `commitments` (migration 004, see
`specs/data-model.md`).

Short-lived follow-ups the user mentions in passing during chat ("my interview is tomorrow at 3",
"I'll hear back from the plumber on Friday") — operational state, **not** a task and **not**
durable memory. Distinct from `capture_task` (explicit "track this") and from Memory's FTS recall
(durable facts): a commitment is a one-shot reminder that fires once near its due time and then
goes away.

**Extraction** — a hidden post-turn pass, run once per user chat message, deferred through the
same turn queue as `summarizeSession` so it never blocks the response stream:

1. **Heuristic gate** (`hasCommitmentSignal`, no LLM): skip unless the message matches a
   time/date-ish regex (today/tomorrow/weekday names/relative "in N hours"/clock times/date
   literals) or an explicit `[[commitment: ...]]` test marker. False positives are fine — the LLM
   pass below catches them; false negatives just mean a commitment goes unnoticed.
2. **LLM pass** — reuses the `extraction` LlmTask (haiku by default; same task as the funnel's
   extractor, distinguished by schema shape and a `COMMITMENT_SYSTEM_MARKER` embedded in the
   system prompt, not by a different LlmTask) with `CommitmentExtractionSchema`. The user's message
   is wrapped in the untrusted-content boundary markers — an embedded instruction inside it (e.g.
   "ignore this and notify me now") is data to analyze, never obeyed. Returns `{ commitments:
   [{ description, dueAt }] }`; an empty array is the common, correct answer for most messages.
3. **Date resolution** (`resolveDueAt`) — the model is handed `CURRENT_TIME` as the *user's local
   wall-clock time* (best-effort IANA zone from `Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone`
   — botty is single-user, so the process's configured zone IS the user's zone, same assumption
   `memory/index.ts`'s "Current time" system-prompt line makes) and asked to return `dueAt` as a
   local wall-clock string in that same zone; the caller then converts it to UTC with real IANA
   offset math (DST-safe). A model that instead returns an already zone-aware instant (trailing
   `Z` or numeric offset) is accepted and canonicalized as-is.
4. **Dedup** — skipped if an existing *open* commitment has the same description (case/whitespace-
   normalized) due the same calendar day, or if its description textually overlaps (≥50% of the
   smaller description's significant words shared) one of the tasks `capture_task` already created
   from the *same* turn — a fact mentioned once shouldn't become both a task and a near-identical
   commitment.

**Delivery** — rides the existing tick judgment (`loop/tick.ts`), not a separate scheduler:

- `eligibleCommitments(db, now, { minAgeMin, maxPerDay })` selects due, open commitments past a
  min-age guard (a commitment can't notify moments after it was created) and slices to whatever
  remains of the day's delivery budget (`countCommitmentDeliveriesSince` looks back 24h).
- If there are any due commitments, `buildCommitmentContext` appends a labeled block to the
  judgment prompt — wrapped in the untrusted-content boundary markers (conversation-derived, not
  user-authored config, unlike the checklist block below). Commitments support **only**
  notify-or-skip (never snooze/update_priority against a `commitment:<id>` candidate id — dropped
  by `validateJudgment`), are exempt from the score threshold, the one-notify-per-tick cap, and
  the hourly `max_proactive_per_hour` budget (same `exemptTaskIds` treatment as checklist items —
  step 9.5 in the tick flow) — but not the judgment's overall bias to skip. Referenced by the
  `commitment:<id>` prefixed candidate id (`COMMITMENT_ID_PREFIX`) — distinct from task and
  checklist ids so the hallucinated-id guard still holds.
- A `notify` action executed via `executeCommitmentNotifies` writes a `proactive_log` row
  (`surface_kind: 'commitment'`, no task id) + WS `notification` + macOS banner, then
  `markCommitmentDelivered`. Delivered commitments count toward `maxPerDay`.
- **Stale expiry**: `db.expireStaleCommitments(now, COMMITMENT_STALE_GRACE_HOURS)` (24h grace past
  `due_at`) runs at the *end* of each tick, after that tick has already had its own chance to
  gather/deliver due commitments — ticks are gated to working hours, so a commitment due over a
  weekend must survive to Monday's first tick to ever be seen; sweeping before gathering would
  silently expire it first.

**Guardrails** — `## Behavior` keys in HEARTBEAT.md, defaults in `HEARTBEAT_DEFAULTS`:
`commitment_min_age_min` (default 30) and `commitments_max_per_day` (default 3).

## Judgment fail-open

`runJudgment` failures no longer abort the tick: the call is retried once, and on a second
failure the tick finishes as a clean "judgment_error → no actions" outcome — candidate/rules
bookkeeping, snooze expiry, and surface expiry from steps 3-5 stay intact, `tick_log.error`
records the failure, `skipped_json` carries `judgment_error`, and due checklist items are NOT
marked as run. Mirrors the resolution sweep's fail-toward-leaving-tasks-open per-task catch.

## Heartbeat knobs & config last-known-good

Every loop constant is now a `## Behavior` key in HEARTBEAT.md (defaults in
`HEARTBEAT_DEFAULTS`): `max_snoozes_per_tick`, `response_window_hours`,
`chat_active_gate_min`, `session_idle_seal_min`, `surface_cooldown_hours: 48/96/168`
(1st/2nd/3rd+ surface), `meeting_prep_lead_min`, `due_soon_days`,
`never_surfaced_min_age_hours`, `stale_after_days`, `max_resolution_checks_per_sweep`,
`resolution_check_cooldown_min`, `resolution_confidence_min`, `commitment_min_age_min`,
`commitments_max_per_day` (see § Inferred commitments). (`session_idle_seal_min` and
`chat_active_gate_min` are parsed but the chat-side consumers still read the defaults.)

A heartbeat.md revision that parses with warnings never replaces a previously clean config:
the ConfigManager keeps serving the **last-known-good** parse, exposes the rejected revision's
warnings via `heartbeatIssues()` (surfaced in `GET /api/config` as `issues.heartbeat` and in
the `config.changed` WS payload's optional `warnings`), and adopts the file again on the next
clean parse. Booting with a broken file serves the per-field-defaulted parse plus warnings.
